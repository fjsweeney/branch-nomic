# Rule 101
## Radical Freedom
A player has radical freedom to decide the gamestate to be whatever they wish. However, those gamestates only exists in the people who are tracking them, and playing them.

In general, more players means a more valid gamestate, thus, a simple majority is enough to maintain the primary gamestate. (In this fashion, this game requires politics and persuasion, and thereby, may contain some drama.)

Basically, this is a game of nomic wherein the social contract takes precedence, and it only exists as long as people are playing it. 

# Rule 102
## Handling Divergence
Where disputes arise, the gamestate diverges.

When the gamestate diverges, it is enough to highlight the differences in gamestate, so that players may indicate which one, or multiple, they are playing in. Generally, silence is a decision to play no choices, and to stop playing, and indecision or ignorance is a decision continue playing and to play all choices.

A player can decide which changes to play at any time, or change their decision.

# Rule 103
## Proposals
Each turn, a player can declare one or more sets of changes which diverges the gamestate, and other players should decide whether to play it or not.
The following turn, if a player believes a majority of players have accepted their gamestate, e should have that gamestate published, by someone if not emself, to prove that there are no disputes, and to allow new players to enter at any time, and to reaffirm the current gamestate. If multiple sets of changes are adopted, then those changes must be merged, in order to affirm the current gamestate.

# Rule 201
## Definitions
Generally:
- Things happen on a weekly basis, called a turn.
- The gamestate is the set of all things required to play: any values, who is a player, and the rules.

# Rule 202
## Respectfulness
Generally:
- All players should play in with good faith and respect in others.
- In the senses of respectfulness, politics, and persuasion, remember it is possible to respect a person while disagreeing with them, or in the midst of drama.
- We all want to play a game where the rules change - we don't have to be mean or disrespectful about it.
- Scams should therefore be persuasively sound to lessen the amount of divergence.

# Rule 301
## Playing
There exists a story, and within it, each player has a character. A player should describe their character's qualities, location, etc.  when joining the game. Once each turn, a player can have their character interact with the story and the other characters in a significant way. A player can have a character can interact in an insignificant way at any time.

# Rule 302
## Currency?
Every turn, a player can have a star interact with their character, granting them 1 stardust.
