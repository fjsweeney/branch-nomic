# The Beginning
The stars whispered quietly on a clear night, foretelling ominous and opulent promises to their listeners.
[Skoogen](players/4st.md) listened, but all e heard was "something is awakening". 
E prepared emself a lil' potion and left on a cliche journey, escaping eir woodsy home towards the Unknown,
a great city ironically known throughout the lands, seas, and stars.

The Unknown was a great land. Great until recently. The prior king recently went mad due to the pressure of civics, and not much is known of what has become of him, and a new king, Praqueue of Shenaniganery, spends eir limited free time taking cogs from the clock tower. Maniacal giggling can be heard as e prances back to the palace with the metal widgets, jingling as e goes along.

Skoogen walked the city paths to the palace. Surely the local king must know of the stars and can assure the lil' gnome! The paths were labrynthian and long for eir short legs, but eir time was not worthless; even here in the depths of the city the stars could be heard. Awfully loud, so loud, in fact, that Skoogen turned about and bopped one on the head! The dust twinkled brightly as it left a glowing stain on the cobblestone. Always the same message....

Regardless, e glowed slightly as e entered the palace doors, only to find the King jangling right behind em.

Erstwhile, the stars were not as innocent as they appeared, for they were the ones awakening "the thing". 
Across the lands and seas, far from the Unknown, the great outbursts of the awakening nevertheless fueled the stars' twinkling delights. Cracks on the surface of the world, fuming billowing dark clouds, glowing red, smelling of sulfur and sounding of great, primal roars... The Great Eastern Capital now had building-sized footprints at its foothills.

On a well-travelled path between the Great Eastern Capital and the Unknown, Kearan marches towards the Unknown.
E has no ear for the stars and for their mumbling, for e has an important mission: e must deliver all 156 letters addressed to the people of the Unknown, and e must do it quickly, lest the Courrier Guild strip em of eir credentials (This would be disasterous. E shudders just thinking about it.).
