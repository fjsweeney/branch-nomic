# The Beginning
The stars whispered quietly on a clear night, foretelling ominous and opulent promises to their listeners.
[Skoogen](players/4st.md) listened, but all e heard was "something is awakening". 
E prepared emself a lil' potion and left on a cliche journey, escaping eir woodsy home towards the Unknown,
a great city ironically known throughout the lands, seas, and stars.
(4st's next turn here-ish?)  

(insert character here-ish?)  

Erstwhile, the stars were not as innocent as they appeared, for they were the ones awakening "the thing". 
Across the lands and seas, far from Skoogen and the Unknown, the great outbursts of the awakening nevertheless fueled the stars' twinkling delights.

On a well-travelled path between the Great Eastern Capital and the Unknown, Kearan marches towards the Unknown.
E has no ear for the stars and for their mumbling, for e has an important mission: e must deliver all 156 letters addressed to the people of the Unknown, and e must do it quickly, lest the Courrier Guild strip em of eir credentials (This would be disasterous. E shudders just thinking about it.).
